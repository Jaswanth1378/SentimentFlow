# Self-Healing Classification System

## Overview

This is an industry-level machine learning classification system that performs sentiment analysis using a LoRA fine-tuned DistilBERT model orchestrated through a LangGraph DAG workflow. The system implements intelligent confidence-based fallback mechanisms to handle low-confidence predictions through either human-in-the-loop clarification or automatic escalation to a zero-shot backup model (BART-MNLI). All predictions are logged with structured JSON for complete audit trails.

The system processes text inputs through a 4-node DAG: Inference → Confidence Check → Fallback (conditional) → Final Decision, with decisions based on configurable confidence thresholds (≥75% auto-accept, 50-75% user clarification, <50% backup model escalation).

## System Architecture

### Core ML Pipeline

**Model Architecture**: LoRA-tuned DistilBERT for parameter-efficient training
- Base model: `distilbert-base-uncased` or pre-trained `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`
- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) with LoRA: r=8, alpha=32, targeting q_lin/v_lin modules
- Only ~1% of parameters are trainable, reducing VRAM requirements and checkpoint size
- Temperature scaling support for probability calibration to improve confidence estimates

**Training Framework**: Hugging Face ecosystem
- Dataset: IMDb sentiment dataset loaded via `datasets` library
- Training: Transformers Trainer with configurable batch sizes, learning rates, and evaluation strategies
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1, Precision/Recall computed via sklearn
- Model persistence: Checkpoints saved to `checkpoints/model/` directory

### LangGraph DAG Orchestration

**Workflow Design**: 4-node directed acyclic graph using LangGraph StateGraph

1. **InferenceNode**: Runs the fine-tuned model
   - Tokenizes input text with truncation (max 512 tokens)
   - Generates logits and applies temperature scaling
   - Returns predicted label, probability distribution, confidence score

2. **ConfidenceCheckNode**: Decision router based on confidence thresholds
   - HIGH (≥75%): Route to direct acceptance
   - MEDIUM (50-75%): Route to user clarification fallback
   - LOW (<50%): Route to backup model escalation

3. **FallbackNode**: Conditional execution based on confidence level
   - **Clarification Strategy**: Interactive CLI prompts user for correction (medium confidence)
   - **Escalation Strategy**: Zero-shot classification via BART-MNLI (low confidence)
   - Only activated when confidence < 75%

4. **FinalDecisionNode**: Aggregates results and logs to structured JSON
   - Generates unique request ID
   - Captures complete decision path (direct/clarification/backup)
   - Writes to `logs/app.jsonl` with timestamps and full metadata

**State Management**: TypedDict-based state flows between nodes containing text, labels, probabilities, confidence scores, fallback flags, and user responses

### CLI Interface

**Framework**: Typer with Rich for terminal UI
- Interactive mode: Enables human-in-the-loop fallback with user prompts
- Non-interactive mode: Auto-escalates to backup model without user input
- Configurable temperature parameter for calibration
- Rich console formatting with colored output, panels, and progress indicators

### Logging and Observability

**Structured Logging**: Dual logging system
- Standard logs: File-based (`logs/app.log`) and console via Python logging
- Structured logs: JSONL format (`logs/app.jsonl`) via structlog with ISO timestamps
- Each entry captures: request_id, input_text, predictions, confidence, fallback events, user responses, final decisions

**Monitoring Integration Points**: 
- WandB project configuration for experiment tracking
- Evaluation metrics logged during training (accuracy, F1)
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE) computation for temperature scaling validation
